# NVIDIA DLI â€“ Getting Started with Deep Learning

This repository contains my final project for the **NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute** course *Getting Started with Deep Learning*.  
The project applies **transfer learning** with VGG16 (PyTorch) to classify fruit images.

This project demonstrates **transfer learning** using PyTorch:

- Load a pre-trained **VGG16** model (`torchvision.models`).
- Freeze base layers and replace classifier head.
- Train the classifier on a fruit dataset.
- Evaluate the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.
